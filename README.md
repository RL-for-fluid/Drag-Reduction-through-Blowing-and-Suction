# Drag-Reduction-through-Blowing-and-Suction  

This page is a repository for rainforcement learning for fluid control.  
Using these source codes you can reproduce the results of the section 3.1 in the paper,  
"Akira Kubo and Masaki Shimizu, Efficient reinforcement learning for fluid flow control, arXiv:2012.04138, 2020".  

## How to use  
1. Prepair the same enviroment as the below repository.   
https://github.com/jerabaul29/Cylinder2DFlowControlDRL  

2. Copy the file "Env2DCylinder.py" and directory "our_RL" into "Cylinder2DFlowControlWithRL".  

3. Run  DAC.py  
> cd Cylinder2DFlowControlWithRL/our_RL  
> python make_mesh.py  
> python DAC.py
